# Taxi-Buddy

So baiscally, here in South africa taxis service 66.5% of South African households, transporting around 15 million people daily. However, the service is not 100% efficient. 
The Taxi drivers do not alwaays know where their customers are. This is a very common problem that is costly for the drivers (fuel) and their customers (time).
This creates an opportunity for an app that helps to connect people using public transport to their rides.
Drivers will be able to see where the customers are, most importantly if someone is already going to get them where they are, and customers can move across town much faster.
Cost soving are created and no more hooting around neighbourhoods for customerss that arent there.
